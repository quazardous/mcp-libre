LibreOffice MCP Server Extension

This extension embeds a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server directly inside
LibreOffice, enabling AI assistants (Claude Desktop, ChatGPT Desktop, etc.)
to manipulate documents in real-time through the UNO API.

Key Features:
- MCP Streamable HTTP on localhost:8765/mcp (JSON-RPC 2.0)
- 100+ tools for Writer, Calc, and Impress documents
- Tree-based heading navigation for large documents
- AI annotations for persistent summaries across sessions
- Search, replace, track changes, comments, styles, tables, images
- Thread-safe main-thread execution via AsyncCallback

Installation:
1. Download the extension (.oxt file)
2. Open LibreOffice
3. Go to Tools > Extension Manager
4. Click "Add" and select the .oxt file
5. Restart LibreOffice

The MCP server starts automatically on http://localhost:8765/mcp.
Configure your AI client to connect to this URL.
