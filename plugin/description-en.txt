LibreOffice MCP Extension

This extension embeds a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server directly inside
LibreOffice, enabling AI assistants (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, etc.)
to manipulate documents in real-time through the UNO API.

Key Features:
- MCP Streamable HTTP on localhost:8765/mcp (JSON-RPC 2.0)
- 67+ tools for Writer, Calc, and Impress documents
- Tree-based heading navigation for large documents
- AI annotations for persistent summaries across sessions
- Search, replace, track changes, comments, styles, tables, images
- Backpressure: queues concurrent requests instead of freezing the UI

Installation:
1. Download the extension (.oxt file)
2. Double-click the .oxt file (or drag into LibreOffice)
3. Restart LibreOffice

The MCP server starts automatically on http://localhost:8765/mcp.
Configure your AI client to connect to this URL.
